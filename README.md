Completion Date: 09/25/2022

Description: This program creates a vector called "wallet" and fills the wallet with a number of random objects, and then prints the
contents of the wallet to the user. 

Implementation: First, we create enums and a class to represent the different types of objects that can be stored in the wallet
(credit cards, photos, miscellaneous cards, paper currency, coins, and playing cards). Next, we create methods that can print each type of object in the wallet. We create arrays containing all possible values of the class and enums that represent our wallet's contents. We randomly determine the number of each type of object in the wallet. We add each type of object to the wallet. We print the contents of the wallet to the user. We randomize the order in which the items appear in the wallet. We print the reordered wallet to the user. We print all instances of each type of object in the wallet to the user.
